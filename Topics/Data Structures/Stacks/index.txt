# Stacks
Stacks are an abstract data type with a bounded(predefined) capacity.

<br>

To help visualize Stacks, parallel it to a stack of video games, where the first element added to the stack is at the bottom. Every time you add a video game, it gets added ontop of the stack.

##### ```Declaration```
```Java
//To declare a Stack, include the type of the content it will hold (Integer, String, etc..) and the Stack name followed by new LinkedList<>():

Stack<_Type_> _name_ = new Stack<_Type_>();
Stack<String> games = new Stack<String>();
```
<br>


##### ```Adding to Queue```
```Java
//to add to stack, stackName.add(x);
//Note that the first thing added is at bottom of stack

games.add("Call of Duty");
games.add("Guitar Hero");
games.add("Super Monkey Ball");
//the games stack from bottom to the top:  "Call of Duty", "Guitar Hero", "Super Monkey Ball"
```
