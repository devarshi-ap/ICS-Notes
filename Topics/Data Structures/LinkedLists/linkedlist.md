# ```LinkedList``` import java.util.LinkedList;
The LinkedList class is almost identical to the ArrayList. The LinkedList class has all of the same methods as the ArrayList class because they both implement the List interface. This means that you can add items, change items, remove items and clear the list in the same way.

<br>

The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list.

##### ```Declaration```
```Java
//To declare a Queue, include the type of the content it will hold (Integer, String, etc..) and the queue name followed by new LinkedList<>():

Queue<Type> queueName = new LinkedList<>();
Queue<Integer> numbers = new LinkedList<>();
Queue<String> bbqLine = new LinkedList<>();
```
